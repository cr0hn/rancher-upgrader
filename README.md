Briefing
========

This project try to solve the problem of upgrading Rancher stack services without the need of using the UI.

```

                           RANCHER_URL -a RANCHER_ACCESS_KEY -k
                           RANCHER_SECRET_KEY [--retires MAX_RETRIES]
                           [--sleep]
